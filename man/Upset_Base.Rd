\arguments{
\item{data}{Data set}

\item{first.col}{First column in data set that represents a set}

\item{last.col}{Last column in data set that represents a set}

\item{nsets}{Number of sets to look at}

\item{nintersects}{Number of intersections to plot}

\item{sets}{Specific sets to look at (Include as combinations. Ex: c("Name1", "Name2"))}

\item{matrix.color}{Color of the intersection points}

\item{main.bar.color}{Color of the main bar plot}

\item{sets.bar.color}{Color of set size bar plot}

\item{point.size}{Size of points in matrix plot}

\item{line.size}{Width of lines in matrix plot}

\item{name.size}{Size of set names in matrix plot}

\item{mb.ratio}{Ratio between matrix plot and main bar plot (Keep in terms of hundreths)}

\item{att.x}{Attribute entered as a string. If att.y is NULL a histogram will be produced. Best if data attached}

\item{att.y}{Attribute entered as a string. Produces a scatter plot vs. att.x. Best if data attached}

\item{expression}{Expression to subset attribute data entered as string (Ex: "ColName > 3"). Best if data attached}

\item{att.pos}{Position of attribute plot. If NULL plot will be at bottom. If "top" it will be above other plots}

\item{att.color}{Color of attribute plot bars or points}

\item{order.matrix}{What the intersections in the matrix should be ordered by}

\item{show.numbers}{Show numbers of intersection sizes above bars}

\item{aggregate.by}{How the data should be aggregated ("degree" or "sets")}

\item{cutoff}{The number of intersections from each set (to cut off at) when aggregating by sets}

\item{queries}{Unified querie of intersections and elements}

\item{elements}{Specific elements to plot entered as a list. First element in list is name of attribute (string) followed by specific elements of attribute.}

\item{elements.color}{Color of element data on plot}
}
\description{
Takes intersections from most abundant sets in a data set and produces a matrix
layout of the intersections, along with plotting their corresponding sizes and
the size of each set used.
