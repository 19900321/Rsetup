\arguments{
\item{data}{Data set}

\item{nsets}{Number of sets to look at}

\item{nintersects}{Number of intersections to plot}

\item{sets}{Specific sets to look at (Include as combinations. Ex: c("Name1", "Name2"))}

\item{matrix.color}{Color of the intersection points}

\item{main.bar.color}{Color of the main bar plot}

\item{sets.bar.color}{Color of set size bar plot}

\item{point.size}{Size of points in matrix plot}

\item{line.size}{Width of lines in matrix plot}

\item{name.size}{Size of set names in matrix plot}

\item{mb.ratio}{Ratio between matrix plot and main bar plot (Keep in terms of hundreths)}

\item{att.x}{Attribute entered as a string. If att.y is NULL a histogram will be produced}

\item{att.y}{Attribute entered as a string. Produces a scatter plot vs. att.x}

\item{expression}{Expression to subset attributes of intersection or element query data. Enter as string (Ex: "ColName > 3")}

\item{att.pos}{Position of attribute plot. If NULL or "bottom" the plot will be at below UpSet plot. If "top" it will be above UpSert plot}

\item{att.color}{Color of attribute histogram bins or scatterplot points for unqueried data represented by main bars. Default set to color of main bars.}

\item{order.matrix}{How the intersections in the matrix should be ordered by. Options include frequency (entered as "freq"), degree, or both in any order.}

\item{show.numbers}{Show numbers of intersection sizes above bars}

\item{aggregate.by}{How the data should be aggregated ("degree" or "sets")}

\item{cutoff}{The number of intersections from each set (to cut off at) when aggregating by sets}

\item{queries}{Unified querie of intersections, elements, and custom row functions. Entered as a list that contains a list of
queries. query is the type of query being conducted. params are the parameters of the query (if any). color is the color of the points on the
plot that will represent the query. If no color is selected one will be provided automatically. active takes TRUE or FALSE, and if
TRUE, it will overlay the bars present  with the results from the query. If FALSE a tick mark will indicate the intersection size.
See examples section on how to do this.}

\item{query.legend}{Position query legend on top or bottom of UpSet plot}

\item{shade.color}{Color of row shading in matrix}

\item{shade.alpha}{Transparency of shading in matrix}

\item{color.pal}{Color palette for attribute plots}

\item{boxplot.summary}{Boxplots representing the distribution of a selected attribute for each intersection. Change param from NULL to "on" for this option.}

\item{custom.plot}{Add own custom ggplot grob to be displayed below the UpSet plot}

\item{query.title.plot}{Title of query plot}

Visualization of set intersections using novel UpSet matrix design.

\details{
Visualization of set data in the layout described by Lex and Gehlenborg in \url{<http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n8/full/nmeth.3033.html>}.
UpSet also allows for visualization of queries on intersections and elements, along with custom queries queries implemented using
Hadley Wickhams apply function. To further analyze the data contained in the intersections, the user may select additional attribute plots
to be displayed alongside the UpSet plot. The user also has the the ability to pass their own plots into the function to further analyze data
data that has already been generated. Most aspects of the UpSet plot are customizable, allowing the user to select the plot that looks best to them.
Depending on how the featuers are selected UpSet can display between 25-65 sets, and between 40-100 intersections.

\note{
Data set must be formatted as described on the orginal UpSet github page: \url{<https://github.com/VCG/upset/wiki>}.
